Overview

Intro

This Project is used as an example to demonstrate various web development concepts, such as:

1. Flexbox
2. Grid
3. The 'hover' and 'cursor:pointer' attributes
4. Cards and Lists
5. Responsive Design

These 5 concepts aren't mutually exclusive to this particular Project, compared to previous Projects with TripleTen, but this one is a culmination of said previous projects. This has been a challenge!

Figma

-   Here is a link to the project on Figma: (https://www.figma.com/file/ii4xxsJ0ghevUOcssTlHZv/Sprint-3%3A-Around-the-US?node-id=0%3A1)

Images

Using Figma is a breeze, and is beneficially simple to use. The Export function makes getting images so easy!
(While it's easy to get the images you need, it's recommended to use an optimizer like https://tinypng.com/ to make sure the file size isn't too big)
